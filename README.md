# Carbon Footprint Calculator
An iOS application built using data from the EPA's carbon footprint calculator (https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/), Swift, and Google Firebase.

Originally planned as an introduction to coding for non-computer science majors in Michigan Eco Data (a University of Michigan environmental club), the project was cut due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges that resulted from club members being forced to fly home to all parts of the world. To make the most of my time in quarantine, I decided to make the application on my own. This is my first experience developing in Swift or for iOS in general.

I hope that this provides a stepping off point for those interested in mobile app development, or that it serves as inspiration for those who want to use technology to aide the environment.
